This is the BioHack Academy documentation site of Tim van Elferen

I have a bachelor in arts and technology at the Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht, where I studied interactive performance arts.
During my internship at the Waag Fablab I worked on the perfomative installation [Series patchmaker No. 1](http://www.marloekevandervlugt.com/www.marloekevandervlugt.com/Installation/Paginas/Series_Patchmaker_No._1.html)
During my graduation I created the poetic installation TÃ˜ ([vimeo](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/15158078)) which uses living organism to interact with the game of life algorithm in order to generate  audiovisual landscapes.

I am currently working freelance as an artistic engineer in the cultural sector, where I develop exhibitions, installations and I install artworks.
My maker skills are tinkering, 3d-modeling, 3d-printing, programming and soldering.

I joined BHA want to learn more about tinkering with living materials, to create meaningfull interactions and to incorporate this in my artistic practise.
